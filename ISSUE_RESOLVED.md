# ✅ Issue Resolved: Flutter Command Now Works!

## 🎯 Problem
When typing `flutter run`, PowerShell showed:
```
flutter : The term 'flutter' is not recognized...
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

### What Was Done:
1. ✅ **Added Flutter to System PATH**
   - Added `C:\Users\Sange\Flutter\bin` to Windows User PATH
   - Cleaned up old incorrect path references

2. ✅ **Refreshed PATH in Current Session**
   - Ran command to reload environment variables without restarting terminal
   - Immediately activated the new PATH

3. ✅ **Created Helper Scripts**
   - **`refresh_path.bat`** - Quick PATH refresh tool
   - **`refresh_path.ps1`** - PowerShell PATH refresh script

4. ✅ **Updated All Documentation**
   - All guides now show the correct solution
   - Added troubleshooting for future sessions

## ✅ Verified Working

Test results:
```bash
PS> flutter --version
✓ Working!

PS> flutter devices
✓ Found 4 devices!

PS> flutter run -d windows
✓ App launching!
```

## 🚀 You Can Now Use Simple Commands!

### In Your Current Terminal (Already Working!)
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Sange\New Aqualink\aqua-link-grow-smart"
flutter run -d windows
flutter run -d android
flutter devices
flutter build apk
```

### In Future Terminal Windows

If you open a NEW PowerShell window and `flutter` is not recognized:

**Quick Fix #1**: Double-click **`refresh_path.bat`**

**Quick Fix #2**: Run this command:
```powershell
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
```

**Alternative**: Close and reopen PowerShell (works after restart/logout)
