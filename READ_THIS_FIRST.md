# 🚀 READ THIS FIRST - How to Run Your App

## ⚡ QUICK START (Easiest Method)

**Just double-click one of these files:**
- **`run_app_windows.bat`** - Run on Windows Desktop (fastest!)
- **`run_app_android.bat`** - Run on Android phone

That's it! Your app will launch! 🎉

## 💻 Using Terminal Commands

### ✅ The Permanent Fix is Applied!

I've set up a **PowerShell Profile** that automatically adds Flutter to your PATH every time you open a new terminal.

### How to Activate It:

1. **Close your current terminal window**
2. **Open a NEW terminal/PowerShell window**
3. Navigate to your project:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\Sange\New Aqualink\aqua-link-grow-smart"
   ```
4. Run your app:
   ```powershell
   flutter run -d windows
   ```

**It will work!** ✅

## ⚠️ If You See "Execution Policy" Error

When you open a new PowerShell window, you might see:
```
cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system
```

**ONE-TIME FIX:** Run this command once:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then close and reopen PowerShell. You'll never see this error again!

## 🔧 If `flutter run` Still Doesn't Work

**Option 1:** Double-click **`refresh_path.bat`** in your project folder

**Option 2:** Run this PowerShell command:
```powershell
. $PROFILE
```

**Option 3:** Use the full path (always works):
```powershell
C:\Users\Sange\Flutter\bin\flutter.bat run -d windows
```

## 📝 Most Common Commands

Once `flutter` works in your terminal:

```powershell
# Run on Windows (fastest for testing)
flutter run -d windows

# Run on Android phone
flutter run -d android

# See all connected devices
flutter devices

# Build Android APK
flutter build apk

# Clean build cache
flutter clean

# Hot reload (when app is running, press 'r')
# Hot restart (when app is running, press 'R')
# Quit app (when app is running, press 'q')
```

   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\Sange\New Aqualink\aqua-link-grow-smart"

## 💡 Remember

**The fix requires you to:**
1. Close and reopen your terminal for the first time
2. (Maybe) allow script execution if prompted
3. That's it! Works forever after that! ✅

**Or just use the batch files** - they always work without any setup! 🚀

## ✅ You're All Set!

Your AquaLink Smart Irrigation System is ready to use!

**Fastest way to see it:** Double-click **`run_app_windows.bat`** 

**Or from terminal:** `flutter run -d windows`

Happy coding! 🎉
